# Learning Selenium Testing with Python
Welcome to my repository where I'm documenting my journey of learning Selenium testing with Python. This repository serves as a record of my progress, the challenges I encounter, and the solutions I discover along the way.
## About
This repository is created with the intention to learn automated testing using Selenium WebDriver with Python. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers and is widely used for testing web applications. With Python's simplicity and Selenium's flexibility, I aim to grasp the fundamentals of automated testing and explore its applications.
## Contents
- Tutorials: This directory contains the tutorials and exercises I'm following to learn Selenium testing with Python.
- Code Snippets: Here, you'll find code snippets, examples, and small projects related to Selenium testing.
- Resources: I'll gather useful articles, documentation, and references about Selenium testing and Python programming.
## Goals
- Gain a solid understanding of Selenium WebDriver and its functionalities.
- Learn how to write effective automated tests for web applications using Python.
- Explore best practices and techniques for writing maintainable and scalable test suites.
- Apply testing principles to real-world projects and scenarios.
## Contribution
While I'm not providing tutorials myself, contributions and suggestions are welcome! If you have any insights, improvements, or additional resources related to Selenium testing with Python, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
## Acknowledgments
I'd like to express my gratitude to the developers and contributors of Selenium and Python for providing excellent tools and documentation that facilitate the learning process.
